# External Data
This directory is for external data files that were not provided by the competition hosts. 
These files should not be committed to Git. 
Files are put here to prevent external data from being downloaded every run.
Make sure to include these files when you make a Kaggle submission, as they will not be included in the Kaggle dataset.
